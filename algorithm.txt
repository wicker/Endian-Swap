===============================================================

Initialize R0 with loop counter (4) for the sum operation 
Initalize R1 with pointer to HEADER array 
Initalize R4 with pointer to CHECKSUM array 

Load byte from R1 into R2, increment pointer in R1 by one 

The loop for HEADER starts here--> 

	Add next byte from R1 to R3, increment R1 by one 
	Add R2 and R3, put result in R2, which is safely outside the loop 
	Decrement the counter 
	Go back to top of loop 

Mainline continues by loading checksum value in R4 into R3 
Test the sum in R2 with checksum in R3 
If R3 != R2, ignore
Else, call BYTES subroutine 

	Get a byte from BYTESOLD array 
	*increment* the BYTESOLD pointer 
	Put that byte into the BYTESNEW array 
	*decrement* the BYTESNEW pointer 
	Decrement the loop counter by one 
	Repeat until done
